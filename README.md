# Camalytics-NBA 🎰⛹🏾: Under Construction
## Overview
Hi I'm Cam! Welcome to the Camalytics-NBA Repository. This repository is dedicated to building statistical models that will provide me with information to make better bets in hope of beating sportsbooks. The data and models in this repository are from and for the NBA, respectively. (hence "-NBA").

I decided to start this project because I love sports and statistics! I also enjoy betting on sports from time to time, so why not try to make models to make some money and have fun!

I have an Instagram page that will be dedicated to analyzing the models and interpreting its results. I will also go in-depth about how I went through creating the models and using them to make predictions. If you would like to follow along the it's [@camalytics][1] on Instagram.
## Coding Files
### Camalytics Regression Analysis
* This is an RMD file, as well as the main file for the repository. Which will be used for data cleaning, model building, model analysis, creating visualizations, and model testing.
### Daily Data
* This script is used to select and output model predictions for the current date.
### Data Checks
* This script is used to check data periodically throughout the cleaning and analysis process to ensure code is written correctly.
### Testing Predictors
* This is an RMD file, where depending on the type of regression (analysis) used. I will test each predictor (variable) in the dataset to determine its statistical significance in univariate regression (analyzing one variable at a time). I have split it into two sections: Multinomial Regression and Binary Logistic Regression
	* Multinomial Regression
		* Determining of _n_ outcomes which is the most likely to happen. (Assuming n \> 2)
	* Binary Logistic Regression
		* Determining which is the most likely of two outcomes
