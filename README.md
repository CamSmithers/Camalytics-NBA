# Camalytics-NBA üé∞‚õπüèæ: Under Construction
## Overview
Hi I'm Cam! Welcome to the Camalytics-NBA Repository. This repository is dedicated to building statistical models that will provide me with information to make better bets in hope of beating sportsbooks. The data and models in this repository are from and for the NBA, respectively. (hence "-NBA").

I decided to start this project because I love sports and statistics! I also enjoy betting on sports from time to time, so why not try to make models to make some money and have fun!

I have an Instagram page that will be dedicated to analyzing the models and interpreting its results. I will also go in-depth about how I went through creating the models and using them to make predictions. If you would like to follow along the it's [@camalytics][1] on Instagram.
