## Overview
Hi I'm Cam! Welcome to the Camalytics-NBA Repository. This repository is dedicated to building statistical models that will provide me with information to make better bets in hope of beating sportsbooks. The data and models in this repositiory are from and for the NBA, respectively. (hence "-NBA").

I decided to start this project because I love sports and statistics! I also enjoy betting on sports from time to time, so why not try to make models to make some money and have fun!

I have an Instagram page that will be decated to analyzing the models and interpreting its results. I will also go indepth about how I went through creating the models and using them to make predictions. If you would like to follow along the it's [@camalytics](https://www.instagram.com/camalytics?igsh=MWczZGlhbzl5eGxoYw%3D%3D&utm_source=qr) on Instrgram.
## Coding Files
Significant Predictors
* This file is used to test for significant predictors within each data set. This allows me to determine which predictors are significant against any outcome I want to look at. Each predictor is placed into a univariate logistic regression model (via the function created), to aid in future multivariable model building in the subsequent files.

New Team Analysis
* This file is used to clean and analyze data at a team level to enable model building.

New Player Analysis
* This file is used to clean and analyze data at a player level to enable model building.

Daily Analysis
* This file is used to get the model predictions for the current data and export them to CSV files.

Analysis of Models
* This files is used to analyze how each model that has been created for team and player outcomes is performing.
